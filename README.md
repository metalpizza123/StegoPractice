# StegoPractice
 Basic steganography system written in a day. Might update later with key system.

Updated with basic key system. While I'm not super certain about the size checking 
of the ciphertext fitting into the host image, I'll test it more. Will implement 
password based key derivation to use instead of key at later date. Maybe.
